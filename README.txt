This is the coresponding algorithm for "A symbolic AI Approach for UAV Exploration Tasks".

The python script takes one ground truth and one low-resolution prior knowledge in pair to work. Path information need to be set manually int he source code. 

You can change line 12,13 in Behaviors5-5.py to specify image pairs and change pathPlot_v1.py to plot the visualization.
When do the visualization, please do only one pair of map at a time. Batch plotting can be easily extended. 
The output of pathPlot_v1.py is called visualization.png

Please contact zhany217@wfu.edu if you have more questions.
Make sure all pathes are correctly specified. 

Run Behaviors5-5.py first then run pathPlot_v1.py

More data are available in the .zip files. Again, path will need to be manually edited.
